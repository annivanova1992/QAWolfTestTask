Hi, my name is Anna.
I have solid expeience in all things software testing. Delivered projects in the field which saved $$$ money and reputation for companies I worked at.
I am seeking for opportunities which will allow me to apply my coding and testing skills to bring impact for the team and business value for customers.
I think the idea of QA as a service (platform) is very promising and should benefit companies a lot.
